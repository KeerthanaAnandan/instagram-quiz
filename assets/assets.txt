Do not lose track of what your audience wants to see. Take their interests into account when creating the content planning.
Do not only focus on your own content. Engage with your audiences. Reply to comments and like their content too.
Stay close to yourself while planning the content. Your audience easily smells when something isn’t authentic.

We have some tips for you!
Prioritize your daily activities and make sure there is a clear hierarchical structure in this.
If your procrastination negatively impacts your business or Instagram strategy, take a step back. Lessen the quantity of content you post, but post consistently. It’s better to post 2 times a week on set days rather than 5 times at random moments.
If your procrastination stems from not looking forward to posting content, re-evaluate the reasons for being on Instagram.
If you are lacking motivation and inspiration, send us a message! We will inject you with a healthy dose of vitamin C(reativity).

Of course there is nothing wrong with not posting anything on Instagram. But know that people generally portray their best versions on social media. It is no accurate reflection of reality. Don’t compare yourself to what you see on Instagram, your life doesn’t suck THAT bad!
If you are unaware of all the possibilities that Instagram stories has to offer, sign up for Eureka’s IG Story Crash Course. It will cost you less than a burger, some fries and a shake. ;)
If you don’t think you have post-worthy content for your feed and that is the reason why you dont post, post it in your story instead. It’s the perfect place to share content that you don’t want to have permanently on your account- it disappears in 24 hours. You can also add cool visuals through stories to boost your content.
If you’d like to get more out of Instagram but you’re not sure how, shoot us a DM and we’ll add to your Instagram experience!

The Postponer 
‘’We’ve still got time’’
 ‘’It’s too late now, I’ll post this tomorrow’’. 
 
Planning to read this description now, or tomorrow maybe? You are someone that tends to leave things up to the last minute. You prefer to live in the now and not to think about the nearby future, because who can predict the future anyways right?
 
You don't enjoy planning and scheduling things in advance. Instead, you'd rather go with the flow and do things whenever you feel like it. Yes, you'd like to be more active on Instagram but you just haven't had the "time" to do it yet.  In other words, (AT TIMES) you’re more the "I will do it later" type than an organised freak planner.

The observer 
As an old Dutch saying goes: 
You like to look at a cat in a tree until it comes down again’’.
 
 Wise folk, those Dutchies. And well, it appears you like watching cats in trees too. 
Instead of being active on Instagram, you prefer to look at what other people post online.Commenting and liking posts isn’t your way of doing things. You’re more the silent admirer. 
 
Besides, your main intention when you take to IG is to be entertained, not necessarily to interact. This doesn’t mean you don’t like to stay up-to-date on what other people are doing. Of course you do! It’s just that you have no interest in showing others what you're doing, which is why your account is probably private at this moment. 
 
You don’t really put in the time to share content and cannot be bothered to think about captions to go with it. Ain’t nobody got time for that.

The over-thinker
‘’Wait what if I use this filter instead?’’
 ‘’Oh what will people think of me if I post this instead?’’
 ‘’I don’t know what to post…!’’
 
In other words: you tend to put a substantial amount of thought into what you want to share on your Instagram.
 
You are always wondering about what to post and that keeps you from having the consistency you would like to. You tend to spend quite some time scrolling through Instagram to get inspiration and nothing seems good enough. Your perfectionism and over thinking is getting on your way but you simply don’t know what to do.
