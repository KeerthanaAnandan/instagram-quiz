We have some tips for you!
Do not lose track of what your audience wants to see. Take their interests into account when creating the content planning.
Do not only focus on your own content. Engage with your audiences. Reply to comments and like their content too.
Stay close to yourself while planning the content. Your audience easily smells when something isn’t authentic.

We have some tips for you!
Prioritize your daily activities and make sure there is a clear hierarchical structure in this.
If your procrastination negatively impacts your business or Instagram strategy, take a step back. Lessen the quantity of content you post, but post consistently. It’s better to post 2 times a week on set days rather than 5 times at random moments.
If your procrastination stems from not looking forward to posting content, re-evaluate the reasons for being on Instagram.
If you are lacking motivation and inspiration, send us a message! We will inject you with a healthy dose of vitamin C(reativity).

Of course there is nothing wrong with not posting anything on Instagram. But know that people generally portray their best versions on social media. It is no accurate reflection of reality. Don’t compare yourself to what you see on Instagram, your life doesn’t suck THAT bad!
If you are unaware of all the possibilities that Instagram stories has to offer, sign up for Eureka’s IG Story Crash Course. It will cost you less than a burger, some fries and a shake. ;)
If you don’t think you have post-worthy content for your feed and that is the reason why you dont post, post it in your story instead. It’s the perfect place to share content that you don’t want to have permanently on your account- it disappears in 24 hours. You can also add cool visuals through stories to boost your content.
